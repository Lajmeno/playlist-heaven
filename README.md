This app can store your precious playlists that you have created and collected over the years on Spotify. After signing in through Spotify (OAuth), all your playlists will be retrieved from Spotify and stored in the app. Your collection of playlists can be searched here and more can be added through a Spotify search from within the app. The playlists can also be downloaded as .csv afterwards. These can in turn be used for backup purposes, to restore a playlist to its previous state, or to simply create new playlists on Spotify from within the app using a .csv files.

In Playlist-Heaven, you have a safe space to keep your playlists. This way you won't have to worry about your account or membership. Still, the app stays connected to be able to update its data or to simply open playlists in Spotify with just a click.
